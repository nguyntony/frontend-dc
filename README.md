### Summary
- - - -

> If you take things for granted, you are less “in the moment.” You are less present. You miss out on the things that matter and the people, places, events, and things that are happening because you’re not appreciating them. You miss out on the joy from the simple things.

Beauty is everywhere! That is why we wish to connect people with their local trails and enjoy breathtaking sights!
